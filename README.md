- TODO: More software, maybe for editing pixel art or Audacity (sound/music)

## 1. First-time Setup
TODO

## 2. Development Software
In-depth details about each piece of software and how we can use it to contribute to the project.

### 2.1. Game Maker Studio 2
TODO

### 2.2. GitKraken
GitKraken is pretty cool. TODO: How to use for people who don't use Git often.

## 3. Style Guides
Nothing too crazy, just try to match naming conventions already established in the baseline project!
(i.e. if an object is named oPlayer then use oEnemy, if o_player then use o_enemy)

### 3.1. GML (Game Maker Language)
TODO

## 4. General Troubleshooting
- Q: How do I...?
- A: If it's not in any project README or documented in the codebase: https://www.google.com is your friend!
